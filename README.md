# dotter
> Name is a work in progress

`dotter` aims to allow you to organise you dotfiles in a way similar to GNU Stow, and keep them synchronised with some remote service (github, probably). Further, it will allow the storage of secrets, like SSH keys, by encrypting the contents with a password chosen by the user.  This encryption should be allowed per-file or per-folder to enable people to share the rest of their dotfiles publicly, and keep certain things secret.
